            <p>Through out history, humans have attempted to make communication easier and quicker. Starting with delivering information through the word of mouth, then shifted to using carrier pigeons.</p>
            <p>Eventually, the computer was created and throughout years of development communication over vast distances was finally possible</p>

          <p>Fast forward to today, we are now glued to our devices. Social media is just a click away. We are more connected than ever.</p>
          <p>Socially speaking the use of computers has enabled contact that was previously impossible. You can now talk with someone in real time who is on the other side of the world</p>

          <p>With the help of people like Tim Burners Lee (the father of the internet), the access to information (and unfortunately mis-information) hasn't been more accessible. Originally the World Wide Web, was created to distribute research papers and information, but as you are seeing this, it has become so much more than that.</p>
