            Healthcare has been a field practiced for more than 5000 years. It is an extremely pivotal field that has evolved as much as we have. As the number of possible ailments grows, we must continue to grow in order to ward them off. This is where computing comes to aid. With such a versatile technology, the ways it has aided the industry is endless.

            In 1500, the population of England was around 2.5 million. 500 years later, it sits around 53 million. A ~2560% increase of people all with unique conditions, bodies and ailments. Without computers, files on all these people would probably be kept in some diaries in your local doctor's office. If you were to get sick anywhere else, likely the doctor would have no ide about any past condition or medication you were given. Now, with computers, records are kept in a much more accessible way. Your past history, all contained on file for easier access. Sure, there is the case for privacy and the risk of medical records being leaked: but the benefits of having any doctor know of all your conditions readily outweighs this risk, especially for very vulnerable people.

            CAT scans. PET scans. Gamma cameras. Ultrasound. All computer technology used to aid doctors diangose problems. PET scans allow doctors to gain a 3D representation of an afflicted organ without cutting inside the patient. CAT scans can be used to look at bones in detail. Ultrasounds can be used to view a mother's baby and adress concerns we would have no idea about much earlier in advance. All of these technologies use computers in order to display the images gained from these scans. A truly pivotal innovation in a wide selection of fields. Without this, many serious problems may go undiagnosed.

            The heart monitor beep. A staple in most hospital scenes in fiction, used to represent care given to a patient. Computers can be used for real time assistance like this- an absolute monitor. With monitoring of things like heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, and respiratory rates, computers are imperative in order to care for those at a critical level. Any slight change could mean life or death, and only a computer has the precision to gauge the level.
